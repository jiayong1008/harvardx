in planning their time. 

You will be able to register, login, logout, change your password, modify your weekly schedule table (add, edit, delete),
modify your special events table, and lastly modify your to-do list within this webpage.

Modification of each table will be available in their respective tabs located in the navigation bar at the top. After

In short, weekly schedule is a table where you plan your weekly timetable, it can be your work schedule, school schedule, 
or anything else really. Next, special events table is a table where you can set a date for an event, it can be your 
appointment, meeting, etc. Lastly, to-do list is where you will be able to add your task and assign a date to which the 
task should be completed by. You can also press the 'complete' button once you have finished the task and that task will 
be moved to your 'completed to-do list' table.

The home page is where all your tables, namely weekly schedule, special events, and to-do list table will appear. 
However, the home page is just for viewing purposes, modifications will have to be done in their respecitve tabs.
