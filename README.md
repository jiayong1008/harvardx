# HarvardX
HarvardX is an online learning initiative by *Harvard University* through [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx) online platform. These courses are also taught physically in Harvard itself. This repository contains all my final projects in *Harvard University's* Online Course (CS50X &amp; CS50W). Besides my final projects, other course projects will not be incorporated into this repository as they are against the course's policy. Nevertheless, some of the projects are demonstrated in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtuIDCvRXt9fx1QX43DnXhg/videos). Listed as below are the some of the projects which I have completed:
